TideBrewer
==========

This is a quick and dirty desktop [CoffeScript] editor, made using [Brewer] and [TideSDK].

Basically, I wanted a CoffeScript editor that was easy to use, and allowed me to quickly and easily preview the generated JavaScript. I solved the problem by taking rbcurtis' online editor (Brewer) and modifying it to run on desktop through TideSDK.
